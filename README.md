# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game made using Python and the turtle and random libraries. The objective of the game is to maneuver a line or "snake" around a rectangular board and eat dots or "food" while avoiding colliding with the walls of the board or the snake's own body.

The game features a big dot with more points after every 10 regular dots, as well as gradually increasing speed to make the game more challenging.
